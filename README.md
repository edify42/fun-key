# fun key

lets learn about gen generation and elliptic curves!

figuring out what a point on a curve after a few hops means for us fans of
encryption.

bitcoin is poison so it's good to understand why it's so hard to compute the
private key from a public key.

## generate

the [generate](./generate) directory contains our code to generate test private
and public keys

## verify

How can we know whether we have valid key pairs generated?

### btc pages to check keys

if we successfully generate btc valid keys, that's enough to confirm that the
algorithms are right as rain!
